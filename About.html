            <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in Eagle River, Alaska where
            I attended the University of Alaska Anchorage and Graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science. 
            I have a pasion for learning and it doesnt stop at graduation; it drives me to continue spending my time learning and practicing different
            skills, aswell as searching for a company to make contribute my hard work, problem solving, and love for learning to their team.
            I know spend my time searching for a job and expanding my knowledge of many subjects throughout the field.
            Some hobbies I enjoy in Alaska are hiking with my best friend,
            skiing at Alyeska, and playing basketball.
